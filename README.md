HEIC to TIFF Converter
A simple, user-friendly desktop application for Windows to batch convert .heic image files to the .tiff format.

Replace the image above with a screenshot of your application.

üåü Features
Easy-to-Use GUI: A clean graphical interface for selecting folders.

Batch Conversion: Convert all .heic files in a folder at once.

Separate Output: Save converted files to a different folder to keep your source images untouched.

Progress Tracking: A real-time progress bar shows the status of the conversion.

Standalone Executable: No need to install Python or any libraries to run the app.

üéØ Motivation
The .heic format, common on modern iPhones, is not natively supported on all versions of Windows, making it difficult to view or edit these photos. This tool was created to provide a simple, offline solution to convert these images into the widely compatible .tiff format.
