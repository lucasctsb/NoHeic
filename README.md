## üåü Features

-   **Easy-to-Use GUI:** A clean graphical interface for selecting folders.
-   **Batch Conversion:** Convert all `.heic` files in a folder at once.
-   **Separate Output:** Save converted files to a different folder to keep your source images untouched.
-   **Progress Tracking:** A real-time progress bar shows the status of the conversion.
-   **Standalone Executable:** No need to install Python or any libraries to run the app.

## üéØ Motivation

The `.heic` format, common on modern iPhones, is not natively supported on all versions of Windows, making it difficult to view or edit these photos. This tool was created to provide a simple, offline solution to convert these images into the widely compatible `.tiff` format.
